## Virtual Hand

### What is Virtual Hand?

Virtual Hand is a project I am working on that will finally solve one of the biggest problems in school: What do you do while waiting for help?

Well, this app aims to remove the downtime. Instead of holding your hand in the air and waiting, you can use an app (or website!) to show your teacher 
that you are in need of help, and during this time you can continue to try and work instead of simply waiting.

## Features I need to add:

* Log in with school account
  * Teachers have a different view
    - Screen has a random number generator for the students to enter the classroom
    - Sidebar to log in / out, show the number generator and show a different screen with list of people who need help, chronologically

* Gray background by default
  * Changes into "help needed" screen (green / red screen) once logged in and class chosen, changes color on touch/click

* Side menu to log in / out, show the help needed screen and show a different screen with list of people who need help, chronologically
 * Ability to click any person in the list and start a text thread
  * This is meant to be a way for students to help each other, without the teacher needing to intervene.

* Kahoot-like verification
  * This means that you can only exist in classes that you are currently having.

## Features I want to add:

* Point / reward system for helping a student
  * Point given by student who requested help, if they deem the help to be sufficient. Is required to choose either 1 or 0 points before requesting help again.
    * The lock can be achieved either by stopping the user from leaving the text thread until rating the help, or by turning off the "help needed" screen until the help has been rated.

* Hidden references and easter eggs

* Dark / Light mode
