## Virtual Hand

### What is Virtual Hand?

Virtual Hand is a project I am working on that will finally solve one of the biggest problems in school: What do you do while waiting for help?

Well, this app aims to remove the downtime. Instead of holding your hand in the air and waiting, you can use an app (or website!) to show your teacher 
that you are in need of help, and during this time you can continue to try and work instead of simply waiting.

## Features I need to add:

* Log in with school account
  * Teachers have a different view
    - Sidebar to log in / out
    - Screen has a random number generator for the students to enter the classroom

* Gray background by default
  * Changes into green / red screen once logged in and class chosen, changes on touch/click

* Side menu to log in / out

* Kahoot-like verification
  * This means that you can only exist in classes that you are currently having.

## Features I want to add:

* Hidden references and easter eggs

* Dark / Light mode
